# Maximizing Reward with Thompson Sampling

Maximize revenues from advertisements using the Thompson Sampling algorithm to display the optimal ad based on the user's context (history of clicking ads).

## Problem Statement

Many business problems can benefit from the approach developed in this project. Here, we assume the objective is to identify the best marketing campaign among several options (nine strategies used in the project). These strategies have different features that differentiate them from one another. The goal is to quickly identify and leverage the strategy with the highest conversion rate.

The success of a campaign is measured by the conversion of the exposed customer. Therefore, the best strategy is the one generating the maximum conversions to the premium plan. One common application of this approach is in advertising or ads.
